This project is officially in its second year. Is the 3rd too late for a new year's resolution? Let's resolve to get back in the swing of working on this regularly.

Goals:
- Figure out grappling
	- **Pushing this for now, want to go back to magic**
- Continue on charge spells
	- Why is health changed firing 3 times per hit?
		- Still no clue but it's not actually causing problems
- Migrated back to instant effects for consistency, now we're using Health's Base Value / Max Health's Base Value as the health bar
- Magic To-Dos
	- Explore "Magic Orbs / Energy Cores - VFX"
		- 8, 15 could be good for fire
		- 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 have void potential
		- 16 could be nature
		- 21 for lightning but needs color change
		- 25 for earth?
	- Stylized Sword Seals VFX
	- Stylized Sword Trails VFX
