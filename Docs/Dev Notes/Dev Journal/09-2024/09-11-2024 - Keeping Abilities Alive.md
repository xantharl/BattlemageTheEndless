Today I'm trying to figure out how to keep abilities alive so I can kill their particle effects as needed. Current mood: incredibly frustrated by the opaqueness of GAS

Goals:
- Fix for finisher attack leaving character with roll
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f32fzAuJyZU
- Have a working magic combo
	- Needs collision for particles
		- **WIP for ice wall**
	- Keep gameplay ability in a state where I can cancel particle effects on next move

Worked: 4-5, 5:15-6
