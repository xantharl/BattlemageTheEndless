Didn't actually get to magic features yesterday but did do some precursor work. I want to bang out a few magic features with lower levels of effort.

Goals:
- Figure out grappling
	- **Pushing this for now, want to go back to magic**
- Magic To-Dos
	- Figure out control scheme
		- **Done** see [[Control Scheme]]
		- Implement control scheme changes
			- Done as much as can be without more features
	- Continue on charge spells
		- First pass implemented yesterday mostly, still WIP
		- Ended up saying screw it this is too complicated, refactoring for simplicity
		- Rework is mostly done, but damage scaling is not functional yet
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors

Worked: 12:15 - 4, 5 - 6:30
