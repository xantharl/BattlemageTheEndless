Didn't actually get to magic features yesterday but did do some precursor work. I want to bang out a few magic features with lower levels of effort.

Goals:
- Figure out grappling
	- **Pushing this for now, want to go back to magic**
- Magic To-Dos
	- Continue on charge spells
		- First pass implemented yesterday mostly, still WIP
		- Ended up saying screw it this is too complicated, refactoring for simplicity
		- Damage scaling is now too functional
		- Why is health changed firing 3 times per hit?
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors

Worked: 4-4:45
