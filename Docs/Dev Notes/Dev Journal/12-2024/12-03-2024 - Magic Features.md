Didn't actually get to magic features yesterday but did do some precursor work. I want to bang out a few magic features with lower levels of effort.

Goals:
- Figure out grappling
	- **Pushing this for now, want to go back to magic**
- Magic To-Dos
	- Figure out control scheme
		- **Done** see [[Control Scheme]]
		- Implement control scheme changes
			- Done as much as can be without more features
	- Impl "Aim" mode
		- Zoom in camera by reducing FOV
		- **Works in the basic sense but needs nuance**
		- Updated to zoom over time
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors

Worked: 11:15 - 1:15, 3:15 - 5
