The holiday season has proven a time of struggle for motivation, but no time like new year's eve to get back at it. I need to finish up charge attacks and move on.

Goals:
- Figure out grappling
	- **Pushing this for now, want to go back to magic**
- Continue on charge spells
	- Damage scaling is now too functional **Fixed Last Time**
	- Why is health changed firing 3 times per hit?
	- Add a sound cue for charging **Done**
	- Add a sound cue for charge finish **Done**
- Magic To-Dos
	- Explore "Magic Orbs / Energy Cores - VFX"

		- 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 have void potential
		- 16 could be nature
		- 21 for lightning but needs color change
		- 25 for earth?
