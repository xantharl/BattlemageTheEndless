Spent a while working on spell ideas

Current Priorities:
1. Define scope of spells I want  
2. Work on hitscan attacks  
3. Get all the initial set of spells implemented  
4. Actually design some levels to play around in  
5. Enemies

Goals:
- Work on spell ability expansion as detailed in [[Spell System]]
	- Implementing projectile system
	- Add "Aim" spawn location for spells with radius and such?
		- Might be hit scan use case but need to decide
	- Implement other properties of Projectile Configuration
		- Make Persistent Area Effect a GA member rather than projectile config?
	- Refactor all the hard coded socket names into global constants
- Spent a while writing up spell class ideas

Worked: 4:30-5:30
