Feels like i've been working on wallrun for a long while, let's wrap it up today.

Goals:
- Make an obstacle course
	- **WIP**
- Movement tuning:
	- Wall Running
		- Velocity is slowing to 0 over course of the wall run, not sure why
			- Only theory is that it's related to gravity since that's all i'm actually changing
			- **This is fixed but I don't remember how**
		- Fixed a bug with jump refund

Start: 4
End: 5:30 

Closing: I somehow continue to fight with movement redirection on jump
