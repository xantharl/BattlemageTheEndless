Wallrun is mostly working, jump redirection is being difficult.

Goals:
- Make an obstacle course
	- **WIP**
- Movement tuning:
	- Wall Running
		- Get an animation wired up
	- Jump redirection
		- Jump input is firing twice, unsure why. **Figured it out, redundant input mapping in the BP**

Start: 7:30
Finish: 8:15 

Closing: Pretty short session but figured out a big that was driving me nuts, so it's progress.
