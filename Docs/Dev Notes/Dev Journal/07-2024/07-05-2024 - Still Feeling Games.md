Last time was productive for more movement tuning and adding dodge. Today will be very short with maybe more later.

Goals:
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
	- **In Progress**
- Tune up player controller feel
	- Landing feels too heavy?
	- Make Double Jump velocity redirection respect input direction  
		- **Done**
- Add Vaulting
- Make dodge feel smoother
	- Want it to be frictionless slide sideways rather than leap
	- Back dodge should cancel momentum if going forward
- Modify slide duration based on slopes

Start: 12:30
Break: 
End: 1:00

Closing: Ended up being a very short session but got some minor changes done
