Last time was short but productive. Today will be a longer session and hopefully end with all the main movement elements in place

Goals:
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
	- **In Progress**
- Tune up player controller feel
	- Landing feels too heavy?
- Add Vaulting
	- **Done, it was a bit of a pain but we got there**
- Make dodge feel smoother
	- Want it to be frictionless slide sideways rather than leap
	- Back dodge should cancel momentum if going forward
	- **Both done, animations are janky but picking my battles for now**
- Disable strafe slide
- Modify slide duration based on slopes
- Wall Cling
- Wall Running

Start: 1:15
Break: 4:00 - 6
End: 9:45

Closing: Vaulting is proving to be more difficult than I had expected, I got past the animation issue and am almost there. Just need to figure out why the character is being blocked even with collision for world static disabled.
**Update** Worked on it longer and it's working, now on to adding a low vault
