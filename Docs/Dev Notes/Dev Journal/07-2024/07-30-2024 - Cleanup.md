- Code and project cleanup
	- It's a mess!
	- Don't break anything!
	- Thought: Move MovementAbilities into their own class
		- Is there enough overlap?
			- CanPerformAbility
			- StartAbility
			- EndAbility
			- IsActive bit to use for IsWallRunning, IsVaulting, etc
		- Should work for vault, wallrun, dodge, maybe even jump?
		- How to avoid circular dependency?
- Bug: Wall Run seems to end at the same time regardless of configured duration
