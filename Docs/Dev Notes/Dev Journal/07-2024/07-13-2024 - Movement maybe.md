It has been a week since I last developed. Not great but roboquest has been calling and dnd is resumed for a few weeks. Today I want to get a basic obstacle course set up to test and tune movement, and then maybe add some new movement features.

Goals:
- Add a low vault
- Make an obstacle course
- Movement tuning:
	- Disable strafe slide
	- Modify slide duration based on slopes
	- Wall Running?

Start: 1:30
End: 3:00
Start 2: 8:15
Finish 2: 10:15

Closing: Started an obstacle course tutorial map, might come back later, not sure yet. **Update** Came back and got wallrun most of the way there, having some math problems though.
