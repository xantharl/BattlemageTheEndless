Yesterday i actually got around to some movement feel, today will be more

Goals:
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
	- **In Progress**
- Tune up player controller feel
	- Landing feels too heavy?
	- Make launch jump only out of a slide, and more forward than up
		- **Done**
	- Make sprinting resume after large direction change if shift is still held
		- **Done, turned out to be my code not respecting sprint speed**
	- Make Double Jump velocity redirection respect input direction
- Add Vaulting
- Add side and back dodge
	- **Works but needs tuning**

Start: 4:15
Break: 4:45 - 6
End: 8:30

Closing: Good progress again though dodge turned out to be more challenging than expected, mostly due to a lack of understanding with regard to enhanced input action things. There's more work to be done on player controlled but it's coming together.
