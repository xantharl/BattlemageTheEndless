Yesterday I started on obstacles and then tangented off to wallrun, let's finish that up.

Goals:
- Make an obstacle course
	- **WIP**
- Movement tuning:
	- Wall Running **Working but no animation yet, still want to add on fall**

Start: 10:15
Break: 2-2:45
Finish: 5:30

Closing: Wall running works now but needs an animation, and needs to have more generous detection. Thinking rays 45 degrees to each side of view angle and possibly factoring in input direction

P.S. Vector math is hard when you haven't done it in 10 years
