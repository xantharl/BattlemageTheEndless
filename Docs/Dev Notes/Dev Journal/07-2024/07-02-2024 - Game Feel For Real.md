I keep getting sidetracked in my quest to make the game feel better from a controller standpoint. Let's make some actual progress today.

Goals:
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
	- **In Progress**
- Tune up player controller feel
	- Landing feels too heavy?
	- Make launch jump only out of a slide, and more forward than up
		- **In progress**
	- I think launch jump shouldn't allow a double jump
		- Done
	- Second jump should have more impact on direction
		- Done
- Add Vaulting

Start: 5:15
End: 6:00

Closing: Short session, got some good movement changes done though
