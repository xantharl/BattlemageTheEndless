Wallrun is mostly working, trying to finish it up.

Goals:
- Make an obstacle course
	- **WIP**
- Movement tuning:
	- Wall Running
		- Make it work when falling off a platform near a wall **Done**
		- Explore simplified angle finding approach of nearer 90 degree from normal **Done and working well**
	- Jump redirection
		- Jump input is firing twice, unsure why

Start: 3:30
Finish: 6:00

Closing: Wall running works now in all cases, still need animation. Jump redirection is being wonky so i'm trying to fix that but fighting with the trigger firing twice
