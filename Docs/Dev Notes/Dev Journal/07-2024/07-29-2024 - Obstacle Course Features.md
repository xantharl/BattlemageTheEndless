After fixing a lot of little things with movement, it's time to shift gears a bit

- Implement respawning for obstacle course level
	- trigger off minimum z value and/or falling for too long
		- **Going with just a button press, no need to be overly fancy**
	- allow quick respawn with hotkey
		- **Done**
- Implement checkpoints for obstacle course level
	- Actor with only collision mesh
		- **Done** added material for visualization
	- On overlap event to register it as the active checkpoint
		- **Done** 
- Expand on that level
	- Dodge training
- Code and project cleanup
	- It's a mess!
