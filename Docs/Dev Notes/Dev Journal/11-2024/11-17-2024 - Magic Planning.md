Scoped out feature list for all desired spells

Goals:
- Finish spell classes first draft
	- Done, and figured out list of required features
- Add burn to fire spells
	- Statuses can just be Loose GAS tags
	- Use a gameplay cue to indicate fire state
	- Probably want [aggregate by target](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts-ge-stacking) for *most* things. Even void sickness could be by target to simplify.
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors
Worked: 2-4
