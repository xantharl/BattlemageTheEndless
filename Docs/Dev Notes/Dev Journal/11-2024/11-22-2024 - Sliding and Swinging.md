Got most of the way through a refactor of sliding to last until stopped (to support accel/decel)

Goals:
- Make sliding last when on a downslope
	- Implemented but needs testing
- Make sliding gain speed on a downslope
- Figure out grappling
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors
Worked: 5-6:30
