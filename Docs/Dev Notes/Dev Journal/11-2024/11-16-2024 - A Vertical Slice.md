We need a vertical slice of a game to test if we're going to make any decisions, so what's still needed to get there? [Current Priorities](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Current%20Priorities)

Goals:
- Add burn to fire spells
	- Statuses can just be Loose GAS tags
	- Use a gameplay cue to indicate fire state
	- Probably want [aggregate by target](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts-ge-stacking) for *most* things. Even void sickness could be by target to simplify.
Random To-Do:
- Actually Use AttackBaseGameplayAbility::HitEffectActors
Worked: 2:15-5
