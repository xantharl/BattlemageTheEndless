I've worked maybe 8 hours over the last few days on spell orb appearance and projectiles, just haven't bothered to take notes. I also got a new character to work with.
Today i'm going to get GAS set up so I can start adding spells.
- Follow GAS tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb5y4PWtud8&t=105s

The tutorial was hugely helpful in more ways than i expected. Definitely think i'm hitting the point on the dunning kreuger curve where i'm beginning to truly understand the scale of just how much there is to learn still.

Worked: 1:15-3:15
