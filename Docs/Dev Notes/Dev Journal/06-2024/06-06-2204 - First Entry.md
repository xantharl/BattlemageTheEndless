Maybe I'll publish this publicly someday, maybe I won't, but I want to have a quick note per day working on this game as a mental inventory.

The game is in a very very basic state at this point as I learn unreal. I'm feeling rather overwhelmed by all the learning I have ahead of me but optimistic after figuring out basic animation blending yesterday.

Today's goals:
- Finalize camera swap **It works now but is a bit wonky**
	- Character rotates backwards instead of backing up
	- Fixed with **Use Controller Rotation Yaw**
- Allow dropping of carried item
- Start a damage system
