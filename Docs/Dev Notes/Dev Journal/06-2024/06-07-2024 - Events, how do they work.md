I left off last night frustrated by figuring out how to tell a pickup that it has been dropped. Let's keep going on that train.

Today's goals:
- Enable pickup of dropped item **Done, wow that was a doozy**
- Make a better animation or two **Done but can't get proper full body anim, spine won't keyframe**
	- Picking my battles here for the moment, will revisit later and consider good enough for now
- Make a combo attack for the sword
	- **It works, but needs precise follow-up click timing**
	- Enable single action queueing **Done, shockingly easy**
	- Enable holding mouse down? **I don't think I want that to be a thing**
- Start a damage system
	- Made a dummy with a health bar, woohoo

End At: 7:45

Closing Thoughts: Breaking down into small goals is helping, feels like I'm making a lot more progress, psychology is weird. This is starting to feel like it might be something soon.
