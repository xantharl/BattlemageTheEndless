I took a couple days off due to plans and general feeling like I probably should to avoid burnout. There's a couple things I want to get done today.

Goals:
- Finally watch the whole [Intro to Niagara Particles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04k9JDx-KTM) video
	- **Watched it, learned a little, seems like a deep rabbit hole**
- Figure out how to stop the character from being rotated while standing still with weapons
	- **Started on this, but didn't manage to fix it**

Start at: 3:30
Ended at: 5

Trying to update default animations proved a challenge since they're not FK, looking into alternatives
