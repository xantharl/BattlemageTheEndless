Feeling better now that I got combat working passably. That said, it's very basic and there's no weight to hits, let's fix that. This might be a shorter day, I'm pretty tired today.

Today's goals:
- Figure out why drop broke **Fixed, casualty of refactor**
- Add some sort of hit indicator
- Make the target react in some way? Should this only be on combo finisher?
- Figure out how to blend sword anim into main state better
- Start on Spells

Started at: 4:45
Break From: 5-6
End At: 7

Closing Thoughts: Didn't really do much today, kind of figuring out where to go next. Settled on some particle learning for hit effects https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04k9JDx-KTM
