Yesterday was a bit of floundering and no real progress, though i did fix a small bug. Today I want to experiment with getting an offhand weapon going. This will be a fairly short session today.

Today's goals:
- Add Physics to pickups **Done, and it turns off when they're picked up so it doesn't spaz out**
- Refactor the Character class to support multiple equipped weapons
- Modify pickups to support multiple weapons
- Add the ability to change weapons

Started At: 3:30
End At: 4:45

Closing Thoughts: Got sidetracked trying to track down a bug with key binding removal and ended up achieving not a whole lot today.
