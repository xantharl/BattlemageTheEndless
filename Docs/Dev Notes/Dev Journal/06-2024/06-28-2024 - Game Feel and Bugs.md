Yesterday I got to working dual wield attacks including magic which was pretty nice. While lots of things are working now, game feel is very lacking. I'll probably need more room to play around in the map to tune things up.

Goals:
- Figure out why moving backwards is so glitchy
- Figure out startup exception
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
- Tune up player controller feel
- Slide Animation

Start: 4:45
Break: 6:45-7:45
End: 8:45

I went down a blendspace rabbithole with some new animations, so none of the goals were achieved but we have better standard animations.
