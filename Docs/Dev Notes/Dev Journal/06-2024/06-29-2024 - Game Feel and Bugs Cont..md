Yesterday I ended up sidetracked on blendspace setup. That's mostly done so now I should be able to move on to the extra goals.

Goals:
- Figure out why moving backwards is so glitchy
	- **Fixed, it was shouldmove which needed to work in reverse**
	- Also completely overhauled blendspace for movement
- Figure out startup exception
	- **Done, was a simple settings issue**
- **Added** Fix Double Jump Bug
	- **Fixed**
- **Added** Make Crouch animations happen
	- **Done an surprisingly quickly**
- **Added** Figure out a slide animation
- Slide Animation
	- **Was done in 5 minutes**
	- *However* i went down a rabbit hole figuring out how to set height differently for crouch and slide, now solved
- Expand playable area and add some platforming elements
- Tune up player controller feel

Start: 3:15
Break: 4:30-5:00
Break: 5:30-6:45
End: 9:45

Closing: The initial goals were very much not what I ended up doing, but it was productive nonetheless. We have full running, crouched, and slide animations set up. Player controller feel need to be next. Base jump feels lacking and launch jump feels too floaty.
