It's been a week, not great, but life has been busy. I'm sitting down tonight to add some visual effects and make things feel a bit more alive.

Goals:
- Create some spell VFX
	- **Probably a ton of work, might buy some, favorited a few on unreal mktplc**
- Add a weapon trail
	- **I have a working one thanks to a youtube tutorial**
- Implement a spell that does damage?
	- **Done!**

Started: 6:30
Ended: 9:30?

Closing thoughts: Productive after deciding not to do my own VFX (for now)
