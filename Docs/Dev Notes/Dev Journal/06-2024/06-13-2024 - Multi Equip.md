I am struggling to find motivation today. Not a great sign, but trying to power through and add equipment support for the left hand.

Today's goals:
- Add a second weapon to the character class
- Add a socket to attach it to
- Update AttachWeapon to put the item in the left hand if right hand is occupied
- Add/Fix auto sizing of base capsule to weapon mesh

Started At: 4:00
End At: 4:45

Closing Thoughts: Got sidetracked trying to track down a bug with key binding removal and ended up achieving not a whole lot today.
