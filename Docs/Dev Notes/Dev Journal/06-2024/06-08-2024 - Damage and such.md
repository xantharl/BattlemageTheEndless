Yesterday was essentially a full workday worth of work, and was quite productive despite some frustration on pick ups. Animations aren't perfect but functional, and we have combos now. Let's make a combat system with damage.

Today's goals:
- *Detour* VS update took 15 min
- Set up copilot? Cool
- Make the sword do damage
	- Set up damage on weapon and take damage function for dummy
	- Can't figure out how to get OnComponentHit to fire
	- Found my first unreal engine bug, something to do with IsTemplate on a component registration
- Finish the Dummy
	- Define a max health, 
	- Make it reset after after X seconds of no damage taken
- Add some sort of hit indicator
- Start on Spells

Started at: 2:00
Break From: 3:00 - 3:30
End At: 8:15

Closing Thoughts: Frustrating day. Reworked weapons to get collision working, still doesn't work. Maybe it'll be obvious tomorrow after some food and sleep.
