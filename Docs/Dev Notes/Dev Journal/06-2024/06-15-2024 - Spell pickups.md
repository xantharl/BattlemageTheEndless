Today I want to get spell pickups going, this will probably mean a bit of refactoring the current pickup class.

Today's goals:
- Support multiple equipped items **done**
- Add animation support for two items **done**
- Figure out local offset for weapons to "float" **done?**
- Add projectile support for spells **done
- Get dual wield well and truly working **done**

Started at: 1?
Took about an hour break
Finished at 7:30

Closing thoughts: We have functional dual wielding, and a spell that launched a projectile. The animations are frankly garbage, but that will improve. Next I need to figure out some basic particles to give this thing some feel. Or perhaps go back to working on the player controller. It feels awkwardly floaty at this point.
