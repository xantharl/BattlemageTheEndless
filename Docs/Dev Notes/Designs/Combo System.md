- Class AComboManager:
	- Uses AbilitySystemComponent's GameplayTagManager to get related children and find next attack
	- Defines global value for time before combo ends
	- Responsible for current combo state and activating next attack
		- Managed via [Attributes](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts-a) in the Ability System Component
- Combo and Spell interaction
	- Only Quick Spells can be woven into melee combos
	- Using a spell skips the next phase of the combo
	- Currently equipped spell class is used
	- If multiple are available, most recently used is selected
		- This means we need to track most recently used
		- Can handle via [Responding to Changes in Gameplay Tags](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation?tab=readme-ov-file#421-responding-to-changes-in-gameplay-tags)
