Spells are largely divided by element, and I want each element to have a different focus. All spells described below will have upgrades, but the descriptions here are the base. Spells **cannot** cause friendly fire damage, as that would highly discourage melee options.

Undecided but likely will be limited to a certain amount of spells overall or per class. Classes are designed to function in almost all regards but have their specific niches they excel at.

Characters will have a primary and secondary spell class, in addition to a mobility class and innate spells.
The primary class selection will determine most of the stats. A melee weapon can be forgone in favor of more powerful spells, but this is not recommended.
## Spell Classes
See sub articles for specific spell details, this section details the overall motivation/feel of the classes.

All classes will have class level talents and spell level talents.
