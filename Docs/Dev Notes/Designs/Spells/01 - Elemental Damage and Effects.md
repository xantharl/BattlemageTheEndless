Results of taking elemental damage:
- Fire: Damage per second per stack
- Ice: Slow per stack, Freeze on enough stacks
- Lightning: Stun gauge build up; at full stunned
- Void: Increases all damage against the target
- Nature: Slow per stack (infection), healing effects reduced

# Effects
### Freeze
Target is frozen solid temporarily, fire reduces this time. Any blunt or earth damage taken is increased during this time.
### Frostburn
Reduced attack speed, can go to 0
### Void Sickness
Target takes more damage per stack
### Infection
Target is slowed per stack and any healing on the target has reduced effectiveness
# Notes
A target with both fire and ice stacks takes frostburn instead of standard fire
