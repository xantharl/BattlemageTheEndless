**This is a mobility class** which means it modifies the base move set and has primary/secondary class interactions.
# Class Identity
Creeping in the shadows and pouncing on their prey, Shadow mages prefer to eliminate their targets before they can fight back. A shadow mage is rarely the fastest, but often hits the hardest.
### Assassin's Approach (Enhances Forward Dodge)
Greatly increases the distance of your next forward dodge every X seconds. Additionally applies or amplifies any weapon enhancement effects available. If used on a ledge, will lock on to a nearby target below.

If on cooldown, a standard forward dodge will be performed.
### Shadow Meld (Activates on Crouch)
Every X seconds, become almost perfectly invisible for a time upon crouching. This greatly reduces the chances for enemies to detect the caster until the effect ends. Apply double stacks of the relevant status effect on your next attack.
### Cling (Activated by stopping during a wall run)
Allows the Mage to cling to a wall and aim a precision strike
### High Ground (Enhances Launch Jump)
Greatly increases the height of your Launch Jump and adds class specific interactions.
