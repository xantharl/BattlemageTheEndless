# Class Identity
Close range bruiser with immense battlefield control and survivability. The most melee focused class.
## Passives
### Rock and Stone
Each stack of Rock and Stone grants damage and status resistance. Causing enemies to bleed within a certain range grants stacks of rock and stone.
#### Upgrade Ideas
- Have abilities refresh the active duration of Rock and Stone and/or activate it
### Assisted Targeting
Any target knocked upward by a Stone ability gains projectile attraction until they return to the ground. This is to assist with other players trying to hit targets who may be displaced during casting.
## Offensive Spells
### Earth's Fury
**Quick spell** Summon earthen fists to attack a target in very close range, medium damage and low bleed
#### Upgrade Paths
- Knock up
- Bleed
- More targets
### Boulder Toss
Launch a devastating but slow moving boulder forward from your location, very high damage with little to no status
## Defensive / Utility Spells
### Earthquake
Cause a persistent earthquake on your current location, any creature in the area is slowed and has reduced accuracy for a time
### Erupting Earth / Shockwave
Behaves differently depending on whether caster is on the ground. If in the air, slam to the ground first, taking any creature in your way with you. Then send a cone shaped wave of earth spikes erupting out in front of you, medium damage and heavy bleed. Launches targets hit by spikes if started on ground.
### Bolster
Grant yourself or an ally X charges of Rock and Stone. Allies gain resistance based on your current stats.
### Earthen Embrace
Wrap a target in stone, removing their ability to move. Second phase to pull target to caster. No damage by default, but can upgrade to inflict damage/status.
