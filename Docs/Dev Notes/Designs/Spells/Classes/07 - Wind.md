Dash forward a moderate distance, dealing impact damage in a radius around your end location. Can go in any look direction.

Class Synergies:

- **Storms** Electrified Gust: Ignores collision along the path and deals instantaneous medium stun status to anything in the way

- **Storms** Storm Cell: Greatly increases upward momentum gain
- **Stone** Uppercut: Performs Earth's Fury with a launch up effect, bringing the caster along for the ride
- **Void** Erasure: If a target is low enough on health and is hit by the Updraft's trajectory, it will be erased
