Strategic high utility class with occasional ability for devastating long range single target damage.
## Class Upgrades
## Passives
### Frost Buildup (IDK think of a better name)
Gain a stack of Frost Buildup each time a target is frozen. Your next single target offensive hit consumes all stacks, dealing increased damage and status per stack.
#### Upgrade Paths
- Frost Conservation: If the offensive spell kills its target, keep half of your current stacks of Frost Buildup
- Biting Cold: Increase the amount of damage gained per stack
- Group Cryotherapy: The offensive spell gains an area of effect, dealing half damage and status (after bonuses) to any target in range.
## Offensive Spells
### Arctic Slash
**Quick spell** Performs a slash attack in front of the caster, low damage but high status. Mostly meant for disengaging
#### Upgrade Ideas:
- Empowered Slash: Slash gains a damage or status bonus per stack of Frost Buildup
### Frozen Spear
High velocity long range charged attack, more charge = less drop and more damage
### Hailstorm
Persistent effect which rains down icy projectiles in an area. Fairly limited range, mostly meant for area denial.
## Defensive / Utility Spells
### Ice Wall
Blocks projectiles, second phase to explode it dealing high impact damage.
### Cold Front
Consume two stacks of Frost Buildup to apply heavy Freeze to a nearby target.
### Protective Frost
Apply Elemental Shield (Ice) to an ally
