**This is a mobility class** which means it modifies the base move set and has primary/secondary class interactions.
# Class Identity

#### Upgrade Paths:
- Swift Strike: Blinking within melee range of an enemy automatically performs a melee strike on them 
### Conservation (Enhances Launch Jump)
Launch Jump rapidly accelerates you to your highest momentum value within the last 6 seconds
### Air Brakes

### Frictionless Slide (Enhances Slide)

### Momentum Strike
Weapon attacks and spells with impact gain a damage bonus proportional to your speed
