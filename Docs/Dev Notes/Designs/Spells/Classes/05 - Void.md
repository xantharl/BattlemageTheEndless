# Class Identity
Close range bruiser with immense battlefield control and survivability. The most melee focused class.
## Passives
### Void Hunger
When a target with Void Sickness stacks dies nearby, heal an amount per stack
#### Upgrade Paths
- Endless Hunger: deals less damage per second but does not expire
- Enduring Hunger: longer expiration
- Limitless Hunger: longer range
- Widespread Hunger: Allies gain a portion of your Void Hunger healing
## Offensive Spells
### Void Spike
**Quick spell** Small spear of dark energy. Deals light damage and applies light void sickness.
### Sickening Lash
Lash yourself to all nearby enemies, causing a X stacks of Void Sickness per second as long as you remain in range of them. (Idea; have the lashings turn red when near out of range). Second phase to consume stacks on all targets in range for an instant heal.
### Void's Advance
Launch a slowly moving orb forward. This orb emanates ink tendrils which lash out at targets within range as it travels. Deals heavy void damage to targets it hits. Does not apply void sickness by default.
## Defensive / Utility Spells
### Grasp of the Void
Lob an orb of void energy at a location. It sticks where it lands before swelling in size and drawing enemies in for its entire duration. Applies vulnerability to melee damage. Can be upgraded to add sickness.
### Void Suppression
Harness the energy of the void to lessen the impact of negative status effects on yourself or an ally for a duration. Mechanically this results in lessened DoT effects and more stacks of impairing effects required before final effect.
