Spells are largely divided by element, and I want each element to have a different focus. All spells described below will have upgrades, but the descriptions here are the base. Spell **cannot** cause friendly fire damage, as that would highly discourage melee options.

Undecided but likely will be limited to a certain amount of spells overall or per class.
# Fire
Some burst and lots of sustained damage. Leans toward AOE.
### Fire Bolt
- A simple single projectile fire bolt
- Travels at medium speed 
- Deals light damage and light burn
- Little to no drop
- Very low CD
- **Talent Idea**: Faster firebolt
### Fire Ball
- A slow moving large ball of fire
- Detonates on impact or on re-click dealing medium instant damage and heavy burn
- Leaves behind a burning surface for a few seconds
### Eruption
- Lobs a smallish ball of lava with heavy drop
- Does no on-hit damage
- Launches fire bolt equivalent projectiles randomly from the point of impact for a few seconds
### Flame Blade
- Ignites the character's primary weapon for a few seconds
- Heavy melee while this is active send flames in the attack's direction
- Adds burn to hits with the weapon
- **Talent Idea**: Refresh duration on kill
### Scorched Earth
- Inspired by wall of flame in dnd, makes a section of terrain painful to pass
- Deals heavy burn when entered or in spawn area
### Cleansing Flames
- Deal light fire damage to self or ally to cleanse negative status effects
# Ice
Focused on Slowing/Freezing and burst damage. Leans toward single target.
