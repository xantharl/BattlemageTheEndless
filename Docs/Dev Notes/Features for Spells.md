This article is to assess what is required for desired spells as of 11/17/24. This does not include already implemented features, but will be used to track things going forward.

In Progress:
- Rework control scheme (Est 1hr)
	- Melee on dedicated key
	- Spell cast becomes left click with right click aim
	- (12-1-24) **In progress, needs addl features to test**	- 
- Implement spell aim
	- **Requires HUD**
	- (12-2-24) Zoom added, still no hud element
- Implement negative status effects
	- Make weapon effects apply statuses and/or increase damage
	- **Basic effect system is in play and integrated with a healthbar on dummies**
	- Also added frozen but it doesn't do anything yet
- Figure out object growing with age (Grasp of the Void)
	- Can probably use some sort of age * scale math
	- UE supports actor expiration so it must be tracking actor age

To-Do (In no particular order):
- Implement grapple
	- Theoretically pretty simple, but might require a good deal of fine tuning
- Implement elemental shield concept
	- **Meteor effect looks like a good starting point**
	- Activation is already covered by self cast
	- Will need to handle in OnHit hook
- Implement passives
	- These are pretty varied and will need thought on how to implement in a scalable fashion
	- Create a concept of Classes as a C++ class. Has an associated pickup
	- Migrate granted abilities to the class instead of the pickup
- Implement explosion on contact (Fireball, Noxious Spore) 
	- **I think this is handled by Hit Effect Actors, see fire surface effect on firebolt, make sure i'm covering all the cases**
	- Implement persistent effects
	- Can use HitEffectActor? Or should it be a GC?
	- Spawned actor needs to support OnOverlap events for persistent effects
	- Probably most straightfwd to have a PersistentEffect base class and override the OnOverlap event as needed
- Implement consumption of stacks 
	- Implement for enemies stacks (Nourishing Flames, Harness Decay)
		- Needs to be initiated by caster and check all ASC having characters in range
	- Implement for de-buff removal
		- Logically similar, just a different set of targets
- Implement point-cast spells
	- Use HitScan entry point
	- Holding should show target location
	- Probably ought to be cancelable 
- Refine ice wall for consistency
- Implement buffing allies (Protective Frost, Rock and Stone)
	- Add cast type of Friendly (target self if no ally selected)
	- Probably ought to implement outlines of friendlies to make this more clear
- Implement damage multipliers (Concussive Strikes)
	- Use ability levels and select higher level if concussive strikes is active?
	- Other option is custom handling to apply a multiplier defined in concussive strikes
- Implement knockback/knock up
	- Can likely just define an impulse on the projectile/attack and apply in on hit if needed
	- Might automatically apply in super on hit
- VFX and SFX galore
- Implement target assist (Assisted Targeting)
	- Use same outline functionality as Buffing Allies
	- Best to use a few ray casts within a certain cone angle
- Implement magic weapon (Earth's Fury)
	- This can just be a duration periodic effect with a gameplay cue to "summon" the fists
- Implement tethering self cast concept for Sickening Lash
	- Use a similar VFX approach to chain lightning, but multi target instead of chaining 
	- Maybe define chain modes of sequential vs all from source?
- Implement pull effect (Grasp of the Void)
	- Leverage impulse functionality on hit
	- Implement through Gameplay Effect in EffectsToApply which has a tag for pulling the character
	- This will probably need an implementation of GameplayEffect to define the impulse behavior
- Implement stack spread on death
	- Need to figure out what Callback should be subscribed to for death and handle there
	- Logically pretty simple, just assess a % chance for each stack per ASC
- Implement snare (Nature's Grasp)
	- Gameplay Effect with modifier to movement speed
	- **Requires migration of movement speed effects to GAS**
- Implement Homing (Thorns)
	- Target selected at cast time, can probably replicate logic in IceMagic sample for "target" functionality
- Implement mobility classes, likely ought to refactor movement abilities into GAS while I'm in there
	- This is a whole can of worms requiring more analysis

Done:
- Implement Hold attacks (automatic weapon analogous)
	- Surprisingly complex, will need to do the following:
		- Add support for all ETriggerEvent types in Base Ability, probably a generic OnEventTrigger
		- Rework input handling in character to identify the ability as soon as possible (might differ per ability type)
		- Store the ability handle and/or spec on character so we can easily reference it in following Trigger Event calls
	- (12-31-24) **Done**
