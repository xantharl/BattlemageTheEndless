Current Priorities:
1. Define scope of spells I want  
	1. First draft done
2. Work on hitscan attacks  
	1. Done
3. Get all the initial set of spells implemented  
4. Actually design some levels to play around in  
5. Enemies


- Enough spells to have options
- Make spell cast "point" configurable (e.g. immediately, end of animation, anim notify)
- A GUI / UI overall with class selection options
- A level or two, probably one tutorial and one actual
- Something to fight
