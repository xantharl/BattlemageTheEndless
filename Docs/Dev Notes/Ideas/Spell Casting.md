# Classes
- Classes provide guidelines but are fully customizable (maybe)    
- Ideas are inspired by the typical light/medium/heavy archetypes    
- Stats shown for overview include:    
    - Durability        
    - Speed        
    - Focus        
# Character Kit
1. Weapon    
2. Spell Focus **OR** Shield    
    1. Focus adds interesting spell changes        
    2. Shield does what you'd expect        
3. (Up to) 4 spell categories (thinking of our gamepad friends)    
    1. Mobility Spells are assigned to everyone by default, maybe allow replacing with a confirmation        
    2. 1 to 3 other classes of spells based on archetype     
# Resources
- Preparation and cd only, mana is unfun
# Active Casting
- Similar to Helldivers 2 strategems where each spell requires a sequence of keys    
- Spells have varying levels of complexity based on strength    
# Preparation
- Each class has a certain amount of preparation slots    
- Spells can either be actively cast or stored into a preparation slot    
- Point is to reward preparation during downtime    
- Need a way to force players to move on rather than spend ages preparing    
# Focus
- Similar to DnD Concentration, chance of ending a focused spell when taking damage 
- Mostly passive buff spells, some potential for offense a la telekenesis    
- Light, Medium, and Heavy damage has different odds of breaking focus    
- Different characters have different thresholds for light/medium/heavy damage    
- Can enable auto-renew for focus spells while resource is available    
- **Possibly** an active QTE style mechanic to maintain focus when it would break
